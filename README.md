# Energy-efficiency-analysis-of-buildings
When it comes to efficient building design, the computation of the heating load (HL) and the cooling load (CL) is required to determine the specifications of the heating and cooling equipment needed to maintain comfortable indoor air conditions. In order to estimate the required cooling and heating capacities, architects and building desioners need information about the characteristics of the building and of the conditioned space (for example occupancy and activity level). For this reason, we will investigate the effect of eight input variables: (RC), surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution, to determine the output variables HL and CL of residential buildings.
